# ChromeExtension_Web-Tracker

Web Tracker is a javascript project which helps to save the web address into the chrome extension. I created that Chrome Extension with three buttons
- 1. You can copy the web address and store it.
- 2. A direct option to save the tabs, extension fetch the web address from the chrome inbuilt system and save it.
- 3. Delete all, it will delete the saved entries.
  
It is a robust way to save the bookmarks. And it is good for learning the chrome localstorage and how it works. This Web Tracker uses the local storage to store all the entries and it help to keep it until you can't delete them all.
